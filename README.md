# Boston_house_price_prediction

## Aim of this repository is to solve Boston house price prediction problem and provide an end to end solution to the user so that they can use the trained model for the prediction of price of house.

## Project Description: In this project the explorartory data analysis is provided and feature engineering is also done in order to make data to train the model. Model is trained on different model of regression and a streamlit is used for developed end to end plateform. This projects used 
* Pandas
* Scikit-learn
* Numpy
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Pickle

## Description of Model
### Linear regression - A basic model for solving regression problem. In linear regression our aim to find a best fit line to fit input data feature. A typical equation for line  h<sub>Θ</sub> = Θ<sub>o</sub> + Θ<sub>1</sub> * x<sub>i</sub>
